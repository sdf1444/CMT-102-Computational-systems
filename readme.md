An 8086 assembly program to sort and then compute the Least Median of Squares (LMedS)
(which estimates a `typical' data value in a more robust manner than the average) of a set of positive
numbers. The numbers will be terminated by -1, and should be stored in your program as:
array DW 101,103,108,102,113,13,109,3,11,9,3,2,7,5,11,13,17,19,7,11,73,79,83,89,-1
